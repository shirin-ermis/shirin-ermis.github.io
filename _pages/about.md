Hi! I am a doctoral researcher at the University of Oxford. I use weather forecasts to learn about how extreme weather events such as extreme storms will behave under a changing climate. 

I am affiliated with the [NERC DTP in Environmental Research](https://www.environmental-research.ox.ac.uk) and [St. Cross College](https://www.stx.ox.ac.uk) and receive their [scholarship for a DPhil in Environmental Research](https://www.stx.ox.ac.uk/graduate-scholarship-in-environmental-research). 

Alongside my DPhil, I am working on assessing economic climate damages with the [Oxford Sustainable Law Program](https://www.smithschool.ox.ac.uk/programme/oxford-sustainable-law-programme).
