Hi! I am a doctoral researcher at the University of Oxford. My work is in collaboration with the UK Met Office and focuses on extreme event attribution. My research uses medium-range weather forecasts and seasonal weather predictions to assess changes in extreme weather events, especially mid-latitude storms, using the storyline approach of event attribution.

I am affiliated with the [NERC DTP in Environmental Research](https://www.environmental-research.ox.ac.uk) and [St. Cross College](https://www.stx.ox.ac.uk) and receive their [scholarship for a DPhil in Environmental Research](https://www.stx.ox.ac.uk/graduate-scholarship-in-environmental-research).
